# SENG 271 Spring 2013
The project files for SENG 271 at the University of Victoria with Professor Jens Weber in Spring 2013.

These files are not intended to be used by others, only to serve as examples of my solution. Basically: Don't find these and cheat. Instead, use them to understand how one might attempt the problem. Make yours better!
